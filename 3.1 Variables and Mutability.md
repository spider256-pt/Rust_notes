- In Rust the if a value that is assigned to a variable is by default immutable:
	- For example:
	- $$fn main(){
		let x = 5;
		println!("The value of x is {x}");
		x = 6;
		println!("The value of x is {x}")
	}$$
	- if cargo run gets executed then the compiler will throw an error:
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-11-08 123206.png]]
		- Here the error is ==`cannot assign twice to immutable variable 'x'`== which means by default the variable are immutable.
		- And in the compiler error the it also give a solution too to solve or to fix the problem that is:
			- `let mut x=5;`
		- So complier error are not the trouble but the solution to learn about the different errors. 

- ## Constants:
	- `Constants` are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change.
	- Constants may be set only to a constant expression not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.
	- $$const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60*60*3;$$
	- Here in this code constant name is ==`THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS`== and its value is set to the result of multiplying 60 by 60 by 3.

- ## Shadowing:
	- Declaring the a new variable with same name as a previous variable that already exists.
	- The first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when it use the name variable.
	- Shadow a variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword.
