- The ability to run some code depending on weather a condition is true and to run some code repeatedly while condition is true are basic building block in most programming languages.
- Most basic control flow is `if expressions`and loops.

- ## if-else expressions:
	
	- An `if expression` allows to branch the code depending on the conditions.
	- In this control flow if the block of if gets satisfied then the if block will get executed if it turns to be false the the else block will get executed
	- Example:
		- $$
			  fn main(){
				  let number = 3;
				  
				  if number < 5{
					  println!("The number is less than 5")
				  } else{
					  println!("The number is greater than or equal to 5")
				  }
			  }
		  $$
	- ### Handling multiple Conditions with else if:  
		
		- Rust allows to handle multiple conditions using `else if` expressions.
		- For example:
			- $$
				  fn main(){
					  if number = 6;
						  if number % 4 == 0 {
							  println!("number is divisible by 4");
						  }else if number % 3 == 0 {
							  println!("number is divisible by 3");
						  }else if number % 2 == 0 {
							  println!("number is divisible by 2");
						  }else{
							  println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
						  }
				  }
			  $$
	- ### Using if in a let Statement
		
		-  let statement can be used with if which is an expression to assign the outcome to a variable.
		- Example:
			- $$
				  fn main(){
					  let condition = true;
					  let number = if number{5} else {6};
					  
					  println("The value of number is:{number}");
				  }
			  
			  $$
		- if the types in the condition is mismatched then it throws an error.


- ## Repetition with Loops:
	
	-  It is useful to execute a block of code more than once. Rust provides several loops, which will run through the code inside the loop body.
	- Rust has three kinds of loop:
		- `loop`
		- `while`
		- `for`
	- Example:
		  $$
			  fn main(){
				  loop{
					  println("again!");
				  }
			  }
		  $$
		- This is code will run `"again"` continuously until and unless user and strike ctrl C to stop the loop.
		
	- Rust also have a way to break out of a loop using code. `break` keyword within the loop tells the program when to stop executing  
	- On of the best uses of loop is to retry an operation that might fail.
	
	
	- ### Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops:
		
		-  If there's loop within loops, then ==`break`== and ==`continue`== can be apply to the innermost loop at that point.
		- Loop label can be specified on a loop that that used with ==`break`== and ==`continue`==.
		- Loop label must begin with a single quote.
		- Example:
			- $$
					fn main(){
						let mut count = 0;
						'counting_up: loop{
							println!("count={count}");
							let mut remaining = 10;
							
							loop{
								println!("remaning = {remaining}");
								if remaining == 9{
									break;
								}
								if count == 2{
									break 'counting_up;
								}
								remaining-=1;
							}
							count+=1;
						}
						println!("End count={count}");
					}
			  
			  
			  $$

- ## Conditional loop with while:
	
	- A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop.
		- while the condition is `true`, the loop runs.
		- When the condition ceases to be `true` the program calls break, stopping the loop.
		- It is also possible to implement behavior like this using a combination of `loop`, `if else` and `break`
	- Example:
		
		- $$
			  fn main(){
				  let mut number = 3;
				  while number != 0{
					  prinln!("{number}!");
					  number-=1;
				  }
				  println("LISTOFF!!!!");
			  }
		  $$

## Looping Through a Collection with for loop:

- For loop also depends on the given range.
- Example:
	- $$
		  fn main(){
			  let a = [10,20,30,40,50];
			  
			  for element in a{
				  println!("the value is: {element}");
			  }
		  }
