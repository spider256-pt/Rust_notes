- Function are the prevalent in Rust Code.
- One of the important `function` is `main` function, which is the entry point of many  programs.
- The key word `fn` is used to make function:
	- Example:
		- $$
			  fn main(){
				  println!("Hello world");
			  }
		$$
		- $$
			  fn main(){
				  println!("Hello world");
				  another_function();
			  }
		
			  fn another_funtion(){
				  println("This is an another funtion");
			  }
		  $$
- `fn` keyword, followed by the function name and set of parentheses are used to define a function. 
- The function can be called by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses.
- Rust doesn't care where you define the function, if they are defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

## Parameters:

-  We can define functions to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function's signature.
- When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters.
	- The concrete values are called arguments.
- Example:
	- $$
		  fn main(){
			  another_funtion(5);
		  }
		  fn another_funtion(x: i32){
			  println!("The value of x is {x}");
		  }
	  
	  $$
	- #### Multiple Parameters:
		
		-  While defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas:
			- Example:
				- $$
					  fn main(){
						  print_labled_measurement(5,'h');
					}
						fn print_labled_measurement(value:i32, unit_lable:char){
							println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_lable}");
					}
				  
				  $$

- ## Statements and Expressions:
	
	- ###### Statements:
		- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
	- Expressions:
		- This evaluate to a resultant value.
	
	- Function definitions are also statements.
		- Example:
			- $$
				  fn main(){
					  let x = 5; //this is a statement
				  }
			  $$
	- As statement does not return any value, therefore rust wont allow to assign a let statement to another variable
		
		- $$
			  fn main(){
				  let y = (let x= 6 );
			  }
			  // this will throw a compiler error.
		  
		  $$
		  - But:
			  - $$
				    fn main(){
					    let x = {
						    let y = 2;
						    y+1;
					    };
					    println!("The value of x is {x}");
				    }
			    $$
			  - This wont throw any error.
				  - In the above code the expression part was:
					  - $$
						    {
							    let y = 2; 
							    y+1;
						    }
					    $$

## Function with Return Values:

- Function can return values to the code that calls them. 
- The return values type should be declared using (`->`).
- Example:
	- $$
		  fn five() -> i32{
			  5
		  }
		  fn main(){
			  let x = five();
			  
			  println!("The value of x is {x}");
		  }
	  
	  $$
